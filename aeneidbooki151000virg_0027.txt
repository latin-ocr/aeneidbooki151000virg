INTRODUCTION To VIRGIL. 19

expressive of something solemn or stately. Alliteration is also
a very frequent device of Virgil's.

The following irregularities occur :

l. Many of Virgil’s lines are unfinished‚ though conforming
so far as they go to the regular metre. While in some cases
these half lines may be intentional or very expressive of eer-
tain pathetic emotions, it is possible that Virgil in his final
revision would have altered them. As it is, his finer taste pre-
ferred an incomplete line to one padded out with weak additions.

2. Oecasionally, i before a vowel is given the sound of the ἱ

semi-vowel ῃ,- e.g., abiete is pronouneed (thyete, three syllables ”
instead of four. In such cases the y sound counts as a conso-
nant in making position. This shortening is called Synaeresis.

3. Syllables regularly long are sometimes shortened, chiefly
in the ending -erzmt of the perfect indic. active, and in the
ending -ius of thegen. sing. This is called Systole.

4. A final syllable regularly short is sometimes lengthened.
This lengthening (which is called Diastole) occurs only in the
first syllable of a foot and generally at the caesural pause.
In almost every case the syllable was originally long.

5. It is the exception for a line to end in a monosyllable.
This occurs generally where some earlier Latin poet is imitated,
01· where the sense eorresponds to the abrupt ending.

6. Sometimes the fifth foot is a spondee, chiefly to express
a slow measured movement, or impressive act, or in Greek
proper, names. A line of this sort is called Sponclaic.

7. In a few cases a superfluous syllable (generally -q1ae) is
found at the end of a line, regularly where there could be an
elision with the first word of the next line. Such a case is
called Hypermeter or synaphen.

8.v Sometimes where there is a deeided pause in the sense, or
with Greek proper names, elision does not occur. This non-
elisiou is called Hiatus.
