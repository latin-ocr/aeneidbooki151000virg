NOTES ΟΝ VIRGIL, AENEID 1. Ao

481. tunsae: sreely ‘beating.’ For the tense cf. on l. 382.
pectora: cf. on 1. 228.

482. solo: local abl. aversa: ‘turning away‚’ ‘averting her
face'

483. raptaverat, vendebat: the difference in tense implies that
only the latter was actually represented. Virgil departs some-
, what from Hoiner’s account of this incident. In the Iliad Hector
is thrice chased round the walls of Troy, then overtaken and slain,
after which his body is dragged at the tail of Achilles⁷ chariot to
the Grecian camp. Hectora: cf. on aera, 1. 300.

484. exanimum: ‘now lifeless‚' as Virgil’s idea seems to have
been that Hector was dragged while yet alive behind the chariot.
auro: see 597.

485. vero: emphasizes tum; best translated by emphasis on
‘then’

486. ut: ‘when'; the repetition expressive of emotion. currus:
probably that of Achilles, as l. 483 would suggest.

487. inermes: i.e., as a suppliant. Homer tells how Priam
went secretly to Achilles' tent to ransom his son’s body for
burial.

488. permixtum: z'.e., ‘ joining in battle with.’ ·Achivis: cf. on
viris, l. 440. ⁶

489. ans acies : the Aethiopians whom Homer places, some at
the extreme east, others at the extreme west of the world, and not
towards the south.

490. peltis: abl. of quality.

492. cingula: for the plur. cf. on 1. 57. mammae : dat.
(577). The belt would pass over one shoulder.

493. bellatrix . . . virgo: brought into effective contrast by
their position. Trans. vir90‚ ‘maiden though she be.' viris·
