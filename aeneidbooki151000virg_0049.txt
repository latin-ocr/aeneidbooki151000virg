NOTES οΝ νικοιι, Annam 1. 41

9. quidve dolens: the acc. with doleo states that at which one

feels distress (568. i). For the enclitic re see 503. 51-
Trans. the whole freely, either (1) ‘for what thwarting of her

divine will or from what, resentment‚’ or (2) ‘for what insult, to
her godhead or from what resentment.’

deum: cf. on superum, l. 4. regina deum: Juno, the wife of
Jupiter. volvere: ‘to undergo,' suggesting the notiou either of
rolling a burden along or of passing through a round of mishaps.
Like adire, it depends on impulerit ; the infin. is used more freely
in poetry than in prose, in which we should here have had ut and
subj. (518. vi).

10. pietate: neither piety nor pity quite, but faithful observ-
ance of duty whether to gods, parents, fellow-men, or country.
Trans. ‘goodness.’ Aeneas is constantly called pins by Virgil,
partly from his filial devotion to his father, partly from his dutiful
obedience to the voice of the gods and to the leading of fate.

Thai, so ‘ good ⁷ a man should be visited by the displeasure of the
queen of heaven needs explanation. For the case see 595.

ll. impulerit: subj. in an interrog. clause dependent- on causas
memora (533).

tantaene: for ηε see 342. animis: the dative, depending on
sum which is to be understood. In prose esse is frequently omitted,
especially in compound tenses; in poetry est and sunt also For
the dat. with esse z ‘belong,⁷ see 582.

irae: trans. by the singular ; the plur. of abstract nouns often,
as here, indicates either the intensity or various manifestations of
a feeling. For the thought cf. Milton, ‘ In heavenly hearts could
such perverseness dwell ?'
, 12. antiqua: from the poet's point of view, as at the time of
Aeneas' visit it was just building, 1. 423. Tyrii . . . coloni:
parenthetic ; trans. by relative clause. Carthage was founded by
settlers from Tyre in Phoenicia. tenuere: the ending ere for erunt
is very common in poetry, being convenient for metrical purposes.

13. eontra z placed after one of its two objects. que ε explan-
atory, as in 1. 2. longe: may modify the whole phrase Italiam
