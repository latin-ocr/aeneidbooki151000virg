in the world. Aeneas in ancient times and Augustus in
his own day are regarded as instruments in the hands of fate,
which is a great inscrutable power working out its purposes
in the world through the agency of Rome.

With this idea of universal empire is combined a reverence
for antiquity, for old cnstoms, for the religious saith of early
Italy, and an attachment to all places connected with the his-
tory of the nation.

The Aeneid then, as an epic describing the great part Rome
played in the history of the world, as determined by the divine
decrees, is partly a national and partly a religious epic. It
has only a secondary interest as an epic of human action, as
a pertrayal of manners and character, and it has always been
objected to the Aeneid that its central character is a failure -
that while Aeneas is blameless, picus, and patient, he is unin-
teresting, weak, lacking in energy, that he is a passive tool in
the hands of fate, not a great hero relying upon his own
resources and stirred by ordinary human passions. It lnay be
that Virgil was deterniined in this largely by his weariness of
the civil wars that, had been raging so long, and by the desire
felt everywhere in his days for the restoration of peace, law,
order and piety. This desire was met by Augustus’ policy,
and in this lay the security of Augustus’ position.

Dido stands out as the most life-like and interesting charac-
ter Virgil has drawn, and even if she does represent to the
Roman the hated race of Carthaginians, and even if her deser-
tion by Aeneas calls forth no hint of condemnation from the
poet, we cannot bnt feel that Virgil sympathetically entered
into the tragic nature of Dido’s story.

Apart from character the main sources of human interest
developed in the Aeneid are: the nobility and dignity of the
story itself, apart from its connection with the national senti-
ment3 the interest of two romantio legends, the destruction of
Troy, and the foundation of Carthage3 the soenes familiar,
