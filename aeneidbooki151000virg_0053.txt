NOTES ΟΝ VIRGIL, AENEID 1. 45

39. quippe: ironieal; ‘forsooth or doubtless.’ Pallas: in the
emphatic position for contrast.

40. Argivum: cf. on Danaum, l. 30. ipsos: contrasted with
classem, the vessels. -ponto z ‘ in the sea’ 3 local abl. ; cf. on l. 3.

41. unius: the ‘one man’ was Ajax (the lesser)‚ who, because
of the insult offered Cassandra, a Trojan princess, in the very
sanctuary of, Pallas, on the night of the capture of Troy, was
visited with the vengeance of the goddess when returning to
Greece. et furias ε the latter half of the line is explanatory of the
first half ; for the plural cf. on irae, l. 11. Oilei : possessive gen.
dependent on, not in agreement with, Aperi-3, by a Greek con-

⁴ struction; ‘Ajax (son) of Oileus.’ In scansion εἰ is to be taken

⁴ as one syllable, a diphthong.

42. ipsa: to emphasize the difference between Pallas and her-
self. Pallas had actually been allowed with her own hands to
wield J ove’s thunderbolt.

43. que . . que: as in 1. 18.

46. divom: archaic for dinam ; cf. on superum, l. 4. incedo:
‘move’ ; suggesting the majestic stately tread of a queen. So in
11. 405 and 497. Cf. Shakespeare: ‘ High’st queen of state great
Juno comes ; Ι know her by her gait.’

47. una eum gente: balancing unius, l. 41, and contrasted both
with divom reyina and tot aomos. tot: ‘all these,’ οι· ‘these rnany.’

48. quisquam ε with its usual suggestion of ‘ no one' (457).

49. praeterea: ‘heneeforth,’ ‘any further’; the use of this
word softens the rather peculiar change from the present adorat
to the future imponet, for which some editors read imponit.
supplex: see on l. 64. aris: for the dat. (here to be translated
‘ on⁵) see 577.

50-75. She 9068 to Aeolus, qod of ake mimis, and asks him to
desto-oy the fleat sor her.
