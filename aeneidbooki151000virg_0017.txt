INTRODUCTION 'ro maen„ ll

When in B. C. 41 peace for a time did come, the victorious
Octavian confiscated large tracts of land in Italy and distri-
buted them among his soldiers. Virgil's farm ( his father being
now dead) was thus seized 011, but virgil had become favorabl y

· s known to Asinius Pollio, the governor of the district, and at
his suggestion Virgil went to Rome and appealed to Augustus
Restitution was made by order of Augustus, though Virgil did
not regain his farm, and soon we find Virgil living at Rome
under the patronage oi the court, and on ternis of intimacy
with the leading writers of the day. His first volume of
poetry, the Eologues, a collection of ten pastoral poenis, 00111-
menced before he came to Rome, was completed in Β. C. 37, and
soon after he left Rome and for most of his remaining years
lived in Campania near Naples. From RC. 37 to 30 he worked
at his second great 1106111, the Georgics, a series of four poenis
on husbandry as one of the glories of Italian life. The
remaining eleven years of his life were devoted to his great epic
poem⁷ the Aeneid. We are told that 111 Β. C. 23 he read Books
IL, IV. and VI. to Augustus at the latter's request. In Β. C.

19 the poet had completed his epic, but intended to devote ·

three years more to polishing and revising it. However,
while on a voyage to (111-6606 and Asia that year, he fell
sick at Athens and returned, dying just as he reached
Italy.

In his last illness, dissatisfied with the condition of the
Aeneid‚ he asked his executors- to burn it, but fortunately
Augustus forbade their carrying out Virgil's last wish.

In person Virgil is said to have been tall and dark, of rustic
even awkward appearance. He was gentle, shy and reserved
in manner, and the purity of his life gained him the name of

⁸ Parthenias, ⁴ the maiden. ' No authentia picture exists.

The tomb in which Virgil was buried near ‘Naples long
remained an object of veneration, and virgil himself in the
middle ages came to be looked upon as a sage, magician and
prophet.
