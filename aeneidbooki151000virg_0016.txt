10 MATRICULATION LATIN. ⁸

In this war the gods took part, some, like Jnno, Neptune,
Pallas and Apollo, favoring the Greeks, others, like Venus and
Ma1·s,aiding Troy, though the latter were unable to prevail
orer the destiny dec-reed by fate for Priam and his city.

Aeneas escaped from the burning town and with some fol,
lou-ers sailed away under the special proteo-tion of his mother,
Venus, to found a new city. After many disappointments
and wonderful adventures he lauded in Italy, and from the
settlenielit he planted there grew the great city of Rome, that
in Virgil⁷s day had become the mistress of the whole eivilized
world. The adventures and experiences of Aeneas form the
subject of the poeni calleci the Aeneid.

IL—LIFR OF VIRGIL.

Publius Vergilius* Maro was born ΒΟ. 70 at the little vil-
lage of Andes near Mantua, in the great northern plain of
Italy, watered by the river Padrm, the modern Po. The people
of this country were of Gallie descent and not close kinsmen of
the Romans or southern Italians, and it was not till Virgil
was· twenty-one years of age that they were made full Roman
citizens. Virgil's father lived on a small farm, but was able
to give his son all the advantages of education to be obtained
in those days, perhaps seeing early in his boy some signs of
future greatness. Except that Virgil studied in Cremona and
Milan and at sixteen was sent to Rome to the best teaehers
there, we know practically nothing of his youth. This period
fell between the two great civil wars of Rome, and from what
we know of Virgil’s nature, the comparative peace of his boy-
hood and youth was more congenial to him than the civilewars
that raged from his twenty-second to his fortieth year.-
