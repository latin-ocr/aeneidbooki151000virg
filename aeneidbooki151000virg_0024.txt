V.—THE METRE OF THE AEXEID.

The principle upon which rhythin is based in English poetry
is a regular succession of accented and unaccented syllables.
In Latin, accent has nothing to do with scansion, which
depends rather on the regular succession of long and short
syllables.

LONG AND SHORT SYLLABLES.

Ι Α long syllable is one containing a long—vowel, or a diph-
= thong. ⁵² or even a short vowel before two consonants, orj, x, or
²338- the first syllable in each of the following words is
long: primus, aedes, mentis, major, texo, gaza. Even if one
of the two consonants be at the beginning of another word
t-his‘rule holds, e. 9. the syllable sub is short in suh ipsa, but
long in sub montem. But the rule does not always hold when
the two consonants arel or r preceded by some other letter;
e. ῃ. the first syllable of patris may be short or long.
A short syllable is one containing a short vowel (except in
the cases mentioned in th} preceding paragraph), including
ί regularly all cases where a vowel is followed by another vowel
or diphthong, e. {J- ‘the first syllable in tenet, deus, deae, i,-
short. But genitives in ius have i sometimes short sometimes
long. and many proper names, borrowed from the Greek (in
which this rule does not hold) have a long vowel before another
λ vowel or diphthong‚ e. y. the second syllable ot' Aeneas, Orion.
In scansion 1²23}ae JJot considered, so that the first syllable of
adhuc is not long, while in mihi the first syllable is short as
certainly as if it were spelled mii.
syllables then may be short or long either by nature or by
position,

 

³* The only diphthongs in Latin are ae, au, eu, ei, oe and ui. the two
first being far the commonest.
